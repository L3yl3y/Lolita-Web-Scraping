# Lolita-Web-Scraping
Web scraping project - scraping one of my favourite shops that I frequent on the odd occasion. This youtube video is my inspiration to learn this skill --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M37koTo8NjA&t=158s.

Developer tools are apparently a better option to inspect data than it would be to just right click and "view page source". You can go to "view" and select "Developer" and then "Developer tools" or just use Command-Option-I on the mac (shortcut). I just wanted to add --> I'd really learnt quite a lot from this youtube video -> it was terribly entertaining and disgustingly informative that I feel almost reborn. From learning about cookies to what each component meant when looking at the source code etc.
